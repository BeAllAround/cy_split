# cy_split - re-implementation of built-in Python split function in C, Cython

This is, of course, an experimental project that shows how efficient your functions can be if properly implemented in C.

to build, run the test and draw up the graph:

`bash ./src/build.sh && bash test.sh && python3 draw_graphs.py`
